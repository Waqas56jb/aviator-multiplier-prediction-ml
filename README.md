# aviator-multiplier-prediction-ml
This project uses historical Aviator game multiplier data to predict future outcomes. We apply machine learning techniques to analyze trends, patterns, and statistical behaviors in the crash values. The goal is to forecast upcoming multipliers to understand randomness and uncover potential predictive signals.
